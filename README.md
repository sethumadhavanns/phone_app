Flutter Phone Book Application with Supabase Integration

Developed a fully functional phone book app using Flutter, featuring secure user authentication and data management with Supabase. Key highlights include:

User Authentication: Implemented login and registration flows leveraging Supabase authentication for secure user sessions.

Dark and Light Mode: Added dynamic theme switching, allowing users to toggle between dark and light modes seamlessly.

User-Specific Contacts: Each user can create, edit, and manage their own contacts, ensuring data isolation and privacy.

Contact Management: Users can add contact details along with profile images via image upload functionality integrated with Supabase Storage.

Search & Filter: Implemented efficient search filtering on the home screen to quickly locate contacts.

Favorites & Recent Contacts: Contacts can be marked as favorites; separate views display favorite contacts, recently added contacts, and the full contact list.

Logout: Added a secure logout option to end user sessions safely.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Flutter UI development, state management with Riverpod, asynchronous programming, and backend integration using Supabase.
